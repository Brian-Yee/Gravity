>"I've been reading a lot of Sartre lately."

Is something I wish I could start this article with -- and so I did -- but it's not true.
In actuality, [The Partially Examined Life](https://partiallyexaminedlife.com) has been on a [Sartre binge](https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2019/04/01/ep212-1-sartre/) recently, which I have been following during my early morning commutes.
While I greatly enjoy PEL, over my head looms the ruler of a public school system that beat into me the superiority of primary over secondary sources.
At a certain point you start to question how much you understand of the original author versus what you understood from someone else's point of view.
So here is a quote from primary source of "On Literature"

![Excerpt from On Literature]({{site.url}}/_images/sartre-quote.png)


In short, we humans are _multipliers_ drawing relations that need not exist between things to create a worth greater than the [sum of it's parts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology).
Indeed the cast of PEL are great _multipliers_ drawing multiple relations together and imposing an order on them because they and others find it pleasurable.
I hope to be like that someday, like an artist who has seen a river and seen a tree and then multiplied them together to form a beauty between them.
However I cannot draw, nor can I sing; the only artistic ability I and many others have at our perpetuity is to listen.
This is aptly para-phrased in The Before Trilogy

>I believe if there's any kind of God it wouldn't be in any of us, not you or me but just this little space in between. If there's any kind of magic in this world it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something. I know, it's almost impossible to succeed but who cares really? The answer must be in the attempt.
>
>~ Julie Delpy (as Celine, The Before Trilogy)

When I was younger, my attempt at understanding those truths or divinities from _the little space in between_ meant studying theoretical physics.
As I get older I think the energy is better spent studying the mistakes and failures of my life.
Writing then comes as closure of a self-reflective process, the finishing bow-tie on top a gift which draws the attention of the eye away from the corner scuffs.
Those little protrusions of cardboard peeking out from the cheaper dollar store wrapping paper.
Six corners on a rectangular prism that are two dimensions lower than the bulk property applied to the object from wrapping, yet capable of undermining it.
How can six points embedded in three dimensions ruin a gift of what is effectively an infinite set of dimensions arising out of a social context?

I would hazard a guess that most of our gifts are given due to periodic events (e.g. Christmas, Annivesaries, (non-Dutch) Birthdays) as opposed to random signals (e.g. Weddings, Tokens of Appreciations).
These periodic events often seem like unstable equilibria, every infinitely dimensioned human at the dinner-table asking others to pass the gravy.
Each of these interactions exist purely with a given temporally-periodic agreement in which an unstable equilibria is to met.
This equilibria arises from a social wisdom that it is beneficial to maintain social bonds, yet it often ends up feeling more like social bondage.

So unstable we are that six shitty points on a gift may make one question how much effort someone put into a gift.
Or at the least, this is what I am thinking as I stare at my wrapping job, focusing on those slightly blanched corners protruding from the vibrant red.
So I throw a bow on it to qualm that angst.
Just like I want to write to qualm that angst of self-reflection when life's corners blanch our thin contextual wrapping of it.
In short, I wish to write for closure with a capital C.

# Tinfoil

My view is not unique nor is it refined, it is simply one way of expressing [absurdism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism) throughout a language which has evolved throughout my academic studies.
Slapping an ad-hoc dimensional view, confuses the reader more and is only justified in the communications of the feeling of absurdity rather than what absurdity actually is.
In that regard, it is perhaps more accurate to say, _unique_ but not nongeneralizable.
Anyone can feel this feeling although the mechanism by which we achieve it differs from individual to individual.
As I grow older, as an individual the outwardly perceived quality of life has generally appeared to increase over time.

That is, what others tell me of the quality of my life gets better as I get older, or perhaps it is just that as I get older the people around me grow more polite.
Perhaps, I've just slid into narcissism and this writing serves as the water's reflection I stare at my face with?
Nevertheless, as I've gotten older I perceive people giving more positive accounts on things of mine such as my organization, work-ethic and eating-habits.
Yet with each graying hair (all of which are currently brown) these increasingly iron-clad habits do not hold out this absurdism.
I was told growing up that these habits would create the sure-fire armor, with which to dress with, when facing the world. 
Yet this appears to be likened to an adult telling a six-year old that their Halloween costume truly makes them look like that of a knight. 
When in reality they only have a saucepan on their head and their appendages wrapped in tinfoil.
A foil with which to prevent all foils.
The armor of a blacksmith revealed in a schoolyard battle as the armor of a [whitesmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinsmith).

Indeed the whitesmiths have received an unfair reputation throughout their difficult time on the planet.
Originally a smith designed to work with tin as a metal, their material of choice made them a ready target for the frailty of old houshold appliances.
After an apprenticeship a whitesmith would travel about as a _tinkerer_ (more archaically a _tinker_) trying to raise funds to build their own shop.
Unfortunately tinkerers -- like many current university graduates -- found themselves woefully unprepared to face the "real-world".
One need only look at the absolutely brutal [dictionary terms](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/tinkerer) that evolved from them trying to make it in their trade.

![The many definitions of a tinkerer]({{site.url}}/_images/tinkerer.pg)

Indeed a [miscarriage of justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice) even remains today with a Spiderman villain and a continued frustration of tin with our household appliances.
While we don't really have tinfoil today as it is now _aluminum foil_ we continue to colloquially refer to it as tin. 
Occam's razor suggests this is because it serves the same purpose as its predecessor and requires three less syllables.
I however prefer the much more nefarious view of humanity that still hopes to pin it's frustrations on tin as if it were the villain.
From [cooking forums](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/64219/is-aluminum-foil-porous) to [survivalist forums](https://www.survivalistboards.com/showthread.php?t=117680) we have people complaining about the now porous nature of aluminum foil.
The forums outline in surprising detail on these forums the average thickness of aluminum foil is 10.2µm-17.8µm; the minimum thickness for impermeability appears to be ~15 µm.
When we accidentally crumple or crinkle the foil when laying it over the baking sheet we cause tiny one-dimensional perforations.
As we remove the baking sheet covered in _aluminum_ foil from the oven, and see the grease once again has permeated we cry "GAH! This shoddy _tin_foil!" And in some grave the body turns of a recently graduated whitesmith who died to soon... perhaps at the hands of a disgruntled customer who had had a long day.

I would be remiss here to not take this time to lament about another time that _tin_foil has caused me sadness.
It was seventh grade and my science class was lectured on the importance of scientific instruments and margins of error associated with them.
Our teacher asked "How would one measure the thickness of _tin_foil?" A question begging the answer of the inexpensive electronic [micrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometer) in her hand.
It was our job then to take micrometers and measure the thickness of various brands of _tin_foil.
As a little shit-head  I did not use the micrometer as instructed and instead folded 4 pieces of _tin_foil, 6 times each, pressing them as tightly together as my little arms could muster.
Then with a regular ruler I measured the height and shifted the decimal place by 3 (given 2<sup>10</sup>~1000) to measure the width using zero electronics.
In hindsight, a more accurate measurement could have been achieved by submerging the foil in a graduated cylinder and multiplying the increased height by the ratio of areas.
This increase accuracy would not of changed my failing grade however as the rubric had defined the objective of the task as "learning the proper use of a micrometer". 
I suppose in a way, the moral of that story is that a white knight is as frail as the armor the whitesmith made him. 
But let us note that in general regardless of colour one cannot spell knight without tin.

# Grease

This is how absurdism creeps into us despite solidifying ourselves in an armor of habits.
It is not a formidibility of the grease itself but the _tin_-grade armor we have made that allows it to seep through and congeal around our soul.
Not thick enough to drown in but firm enough to question if it is a natural extension of our skin.
In this way it is like one's bodily fluid trapped under one's skin; a blister created from the friction of everyday life and a part of us until we violently [abject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjection) it.
The pen then, is a sterilized needle with which one should use to pop life's _tinny_ blister.
In a roundabout way, this is where my true fear of writing in the age of the Internet comes from.

The proper way (or so I've read) to pop a blister is with a needle sterilized by rubbing alcohol to avoid infection.
Some people (in a completely reasonable fashion) find their home absent of rubbing alcohol and resort to a "cleanse it with fire" approach, flaming the needle.
Yet this action, if improperly performed, breeds billions of carbon motes passed in place of bacteria -- which while devoid of life -- remains foreign to the body. 
Our fears -- my own fear -- is that it writing on the Internet is more of a trial-by-fire burning us before we can even use the flaming pen for our required medical incession.
A scar doesn't sweat.
The more we are burned by the outside the easier it is to burn ourselves from the inside.
The inability to escape one's body is equivalent to the inability to escape the regulatory functions of one's homeostasis.
Sweat disappates heat and the elbow grease of thick skin must be balanced with the salty grease our softer skin beads.
And yet part of me defines myself in part by counting the scars on my knees and elbows. Why so?

As pointed out humility, _freedom from one's pride and arrogance_, is a useful tool in life. 
However, it is not the only tool of ones one cultivation. 
Ambition, conversability, honesty, respect are all things I seek to find within myself from writing. 
So I plan to stick my neck out like the little worm protrudes from its apple for fresh air on one of its faces; to state my thoughts knowing full well that my head could be bitten off in the end. 
However, like wrapping a gift, most of this is in my head.
Surely most people would simply rather choose to return a wormed-apple to nature instead of biting it?
Then again, there is still a child inside of me asking "What's wrong with eating worms?" to which the best answer my older self can muster is "Nothing I suppose?".
